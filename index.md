I'm a PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton advised by [Simon Levin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/simon-levin) and [Lars Hedin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/lars-hedin). I'm also a recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics. My research is supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/about/about-grfp/) and a Straubel Fellowship.

The kind of ecological theory I enjoy most is:
<ul>
    <li><b>low-dimensional</b>: what is the simplest description of this problem that explains the most variance?</li>
    <li><b>cross-disciplinary</b>: where different fields interface and new applications arise</li>
    <li><b>meaningful</b>: provides fundamental insight into animal welfare, vulnerable biogeochemical stocks, and other neglected problems</li>
</ul>  

I am particularly interested in using tools from mathematics and computer science to examine <b>resource acquisition</b> strategies in plant community assembly (especially in nutrient poor soils) and <b>resource allocation</b> strategies in wild animals (especially phenotypic plasticity in life-history strategies on short evolutionary time scales).

Previously, I worked with [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan) (UC Davis) on carbon and nitrogen cycling in biocrusts. I was also at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) developing a model of resource competition in biocrusts with [Mingzhen Lu](https://www.mingzhenlu-lab.com/) and [Chris Kempes](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/chris-kempes).
